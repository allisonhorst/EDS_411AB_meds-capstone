Week 9 is Faculty\nReviews. That’s why there aren’t shared materials for those weeks.\n\n\n\n",

The 4 slides should be (1) Cover slide,\n(2) Background, (3) Project motivation (or problem / knowledge gap), (4)\nProject objective(s). Your group can decide how you break up the\npresentation - 2 presenters minimum.\nBreak: 2:15pm - 2:30pm PST\n2:30pm -\n3:00pm: Write a summary for the Bren website\nEach MEDS Capstone project will be featured on the Bren website.\nSpend ~10 minutes browsing some MESM project summaries to get\nan idea of what is expected. Then, start drafting your paragraph for the\nwebsite in the shared document.\nContinue to work on your summary after 411A this week. Add a\nfinalized version of your summary to this\nshared google doc by Monday 1/11 at 5pm. We will then share that\ndocument with Melissa Van De Werfhorst (Bren Communications Director) to\npost your summaries to the Bren website.\nFinance - using\nyour group money (3:00pm - 3:30pm)\nMembers of the Bren finance team will join via Zoom to go over\nimportant information about using your Capstone budget & how to use\nit.\nBreak: 3:30pm - 3:45pm\n3:45pm - 4:00pm: Team alias!\nYour team alias - a short, memorable abbreviated name for your\nproject - serves multiple professional purposes, including:\nThe directory name on Taylor\nYour group’s email prefix\nUse in MEDS Capstone communication with faculty and staff\nSpend 15 minutes brainstorming group aliases. Keep in mind that this\nwill likely be part of a file path, so using good practices for naming\nthings is in your best interest. Some examples of team aliases from\nprevious Bren MESM projects are:\nnadatrace (evaluated opportunities for Nada\nGroceries to minimize waste)\nworthwhale (economic valuation of whale watching\n& marine planning in Dominica)\nmaricultura (assessed Brazil’s aquaculture\npotential)\njusthealth (investigated relationships between air\nquality and diabetes risk in California)\nOnce you have decided on your team alias, send it to Brad & Kat\nso they can set up your Taylor directory and group email address.\n4:00 - 5:00pm - Define\nteam roles and report back\nAll teams are required to have a project manager (PM) and\ncommunication manager (CM). Other roles should be decided based on\nproject-specific needs and expectations. Discuss with your team - in\naddition to the PM and CM, what do you think are the most important\nroles for the success of the project?\nAdd your proposed roles to this\nshared doc by the end of the day. You should discuss the proposed\nroles with your faculty advisor, and make updates to the Googlesheet to\nfinalize your project roles by Friday, January 11th.\nWhat you should do before\nnext week:\nAll members should read through the MEDS Capstone\nGuidelines\nPrepare a first draft of the Team Management Plan section of your\nDesign & Implementation Plan (and feel free to work on other\nsections!)\nLet Brad & Kat know your team alias ASAP (so they can create\nyour Taylor directory & email)\nFinalize your summary paragraph for the Bren website, add to this\nshared doc by 5pm on Monday 1/11\nMake sure your project roles are updated on the shared\nGooglesheet\n\n\n\n",
