Photo by David von Diemar on Unsplash\n\n\n\nCourse description\nThe goal of EDS 411A is to facilitate student learning, work and progress on their MEDS Capstone project through lessons, activities, supervised and unsupervised project work, and peer review and feedback. Additionally, EDS 411A provides opportunities for professional and career development (e.g. presentation skills, writing and editing, client relations, team science, panel discussions, and conflict resolution).\nThroughout the course, students will build on skills they have learned in prior MEDS courses to implement them in a real-world data science project, including:\nPrepare professional documentation for a data science project through the Design and Implementation Plan, and Technical Documentation\nPractice project management and reproducible workflows using tools and strategies learned in MEDS courses, establishing clear expectations for group roles and participation, and with frequent updates within and across groups\nContinue to build real-world skills for data science projects through continued collaborative work in git, data analyses and statistics, data visualization and communication, and more\nImplement professional skills for data science careers including code and documentation peer review, team and client relations, scheduling and organizing tools & strategies, and conflict resolution & communication\n\n\n\n",

The 4 slides should be (1) Cover slide, (2) Background, (3) Project motivation (or problem / knowledge gap), (4) Project objective(s). Your group can decide how you break up the presentation - 2 presenters minimum.\nBreak: 2:15pm - 2:30pm PST\n2:30pm - 3:00pm: Write a summary for the Bren website\nEach MEDS Capstone project will be featured on the Bren website. Spend ~10 minutes browsing some MESM project summaries to get an idea of what is expected. Then, start drafting your paragraph for the website in the shared document.\nContinue to work on your summary after 411A this week. Add a finalized version of your summary to this shared google doc by Monday 1/11 at 5pm. We will then share that document with Melissa Van De Werfhorst (Bren Communications Director) to post your summaries to the Bren website.\nFinance - using your group money (3:00pm - 3:30pm)\nMembers of the Bren finance team will join via Zoom to go over important information about using your Capstone budget & how to use it.\nBreak: 3:30pm - 3:45pm\n3:45pm - 4:00pm: Team alias!\nYour team alias - a short, memorable abbreviated name for your project - serves multiple professional purposes, including:\nThe directory name on Taylor\nYour group’s email prefix\nUse in MEDS Capstone communication with faculty and staff\nSpend 15 minutes brainstorming group aliases. Keep in mind that this will likely be part of a file path, so using good practices for naming things is in your best interest. Some examples of team aliases from previous Bren MESM projects are:\nnadatrace (evaluated opportunities for Nada Groceries to minimize waste)\nworthwhale (economic valuation of whale watching & marine planning in Dominica)\nmaricultura (assessed Brazil’s aquaculture potential)\njusthealth (investigated relationships between air quality and diabetes risk in California)\nOnce you have decided on your team alias, send it to Brad & Kat so they can set up your Taylor directory and group email address.\n4:00 - 5:00pm - Define team roles and report back\nAll teams are required to have a project manager (PM) and communication manager (CM). Other roles should be decided based on project-specific needs and expectations. Discuss with your team - in addition to the PM and CM, what do you think are the most important roles for the success of the project?\nAdd your proposed roles to this shared doc by the end of the day. You should discuss the proposed roles with your faculty advisor, and make updates to the Googlesheet to finalize your project roles by Friday, January 11th.\nWhat you should do before next week:\nAll members should read through the MEDS Capstone Guidelines\nPrepare a first draft of the Team Management Plan section of your Design & Implementation Plan (and feel free to work on other sections!)\nLet Brad & Kat know your team alias ASAP (so they can create your Taylor directory & email)\nFinalize your summary paragraph for the Bren website, add to this shared doc by 5pm on Monday 1/11\nMake sure your project roles are updated on the shared Googlesheet\n\n\n\n",

Schematics are encouraged in your D&I plan, so this could / should end up being a final figure in your submitted document.\nBased on your Team Management Plan, create your repo (most likely) or whatever tool you’re using for project accountability & progress tracking. Add action items for each person, each week (i.e. each person should have a “to-do” list). Share with both faculty advisors.\n\n\n\n",
