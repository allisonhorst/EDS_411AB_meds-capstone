Photo by Marvin Meyer on unsplash (https://unsplash.com/photos/SYTO3xs06fU).\n\n\n\nCourse description\nThe goal of EDS 411A is to facilitate student learning, work and progress on their MEDS Capstone project through lessons, activities, supervised and unsupervised project work, and peer review and feedback. Additionally, EDS 411A provides opportunities for professional and career development (e.g. presentation skills, writing and editing, client relations, team science, panel discussions, and conflict resolution).\nThroughout the course, students will build on skills they have learned in prior MEDS courses to implement them in a real-world data science project, including:\nPrepare professional documentation for a data science project through the Design and Implementation Plan, and Technical Documentation\nPractice project management and reproducible workflows using tools and strategies learned in MEDS courses, establishing clear expectations for group roles and participation, and with frequent updates within and across groups\nContinue to build real-world skills for data science projects through continued collaborative work in git, data analyses and statistics, data visualization and communication, and more\nImplement professional skills for data science careers including code and documentation peer review, team and client relations, scheduling and organizing tools & strategies, and conflict resolution & communication\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nNOTE: There are 10 toy Topic sections here, expecting that some teachers may want to have one page per week (for a 10 week course). You are encouraged to structure your course however works best for your class. All of your course information could be on a single page, or you might have a different number of topics, or organize weekly, or any other organization that works for you.\n\nTO UPDATE THIS PAGE: Open and edit the topic_1.Rmd file, in the project root, to delete this placeholder text and customize with your own!\n\nAdd a site page\nThe quick version:\nMake a new R Markdown document, save\nAdd the rendered .html to _site.yaml so the page exists on the site\nBuild to see updated site\nBelow for a bit more detail…\nMake each page an R Markdown document\nTo make a new page:\nWithin your website Project, create a new .Rmd (File > New File > R Markdown). Save it to the project root. For this example, let’s say you’ve saved it as new_page.Rmd.\nIn that .Rmd file, remove everything but the title (which you can change) from the YAML - that’s the top section of the .Rmd, where by default it has title, author, date, etc.\nUpdate the .Rmd to contain whatever you want to have on that page. Don’t know a lot about markdown? Considering switching over to the Visual Editor in RStudio (versions >= 1.4).\nSave the .Rmd\nAdd it to your navigation bar\nOpen the _site.yml file in your Project\nAdd the information to the YAML navbar section, which will almost always be the text that you want to appear in the navigation bar, and the file name of the knitted html that will be automatically rendered to /docs when you Build your website. That would be new_page.html for this example (since the .Rmd it is rendered from is new_page.Rmd). So in the _site.yml I would need to add this to the navbar section:\n    - text: \"A new page!\"\n      href: new_page.html\nNote: YAML is space & indentation specific. Follow the structure that already exists in this template to avoid YAML errors.\nHow is the website finding the html? Notice in the _site.yml file, the output_dir is set to docs. That means when we press ‘Build website’ (in the Build tab in RStudio), our .Rmd pages are knitted to HTML & sent to the _docs folder. This is also important because when we deploy the site (make it live), we will want to deploy from that docs folder using GitHub pages.\nTake a look at some other pages in this template (Resources, Assignments, etc.) to see the structure, & give it a shot!\nDelete/disappear a site page\nThe safest thing to do if you don’t want a page to show up is to remove it from the _site.yml navbar listings. That way, the material on the page still exists as a file in your project, but doesn’t show up on the website – don’t delete a page file unless you are REALLY SURE that you’re never going to want the material on that page ever again.\n\n\n\n",

I think most of them are most useful when you’re trying to make a finalized table with data in it, but if you really want to beautify your website tables there are options.\n\n\n\n",

Open it in your project, update the title and description fields in the YAML, save, then build your site (In RStudio: Build > Build Website) to see the updated title.\nThe label for the short link in the upper right of the page (right side of the navigation bar) is specified in the _site.yml page.

I can have it show up here by include a code chunk that looks like this:\n\n```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = \"80%\", fig.cap = \"USGS image of Mississippi River.\"}\n  knitr::include_graphics(\"img/usgs_sat.jpeg\")\n```\nWhich creates:\n\n\n\nFigure 1: USGS image of Mississippi River.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

To the right of the font example text, you should see an option to ‘+ Select this style’. Click the one(s) you want to select.\nThat will probably bring up a side menu.
